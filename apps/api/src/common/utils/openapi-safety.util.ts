/**
 * Guards OpenAPI parsing against `$ref`-driven SSRF and local file disclosure.
 *
 * `SwaggerParser.dereference()` resolves external references by fetching them —
 * over HTTP(S) and from the local filesystem. That happens for UPLOADED specs
 * too, which bypasses `assertSafeRemoteUrl` entirely: a spec containing
 * `{"$ref": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"}` or
 * `{"$ref": "file:///etc/passwd"}` turns spec import into a request forgery and
 * file-read primitive.
 *
 * We reject external references outright rather than trying to sanitise them.
 * Internal refs (`#/components/...`) are unaffected, which covers the vast
 * majority of real specifications. Supporting vetted remote refs later would
 * mean routing each one through `assertSafeRemoteUrl` before resolution.
