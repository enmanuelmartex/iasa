/**
 * score-v1 — the single scoring formula.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: same input, same output, no clock, no database, no
 * current issue state. Everything that persists or reads a score goes through
 * here; no controller, report service, processor or frontend mapper may
 * implement its own arithmetic.
 *
 * ── A note on `exposureMultiplier` ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The specified formula is
 *
 *     exposureMultiplier = min(2.0, 1 + 0.25 × log2(max(1, distinctAffectedComponents)))
 *     issuePenalty       = severityWeight × exposureMultiplier
 *
 * with a component defined as METHOD + normalizedRoute + component.
 *
 * Applied per FINGERPRINT this multiplier is inert. A fingerprint already
 * contains METHOD, normalizedRoute and component, so one fingerprint has
 * exactly one affected component and the multiplier is always 1.0.
 *
 * It only carries meaning when penalties are grouped per RULE
 * (pluginId + ruleId): "missing HSTS affects 12 endpoints" is genuinely worse
 * than "missing HSTS affects 1", and that breadth is what the multiplier
 * expresses. Grouping per rule also preserves discrimination — penalising each
 * fingerprint separately drives the score to 0 at four critical endpoints,
 * which is the immediate-saturation failure the scoring brief explicitly ruled
 * out.
 *
 * So: deduplicate by fingerprint (an issue detected many times is one issue),
 * then apply one exposure-scaled penalty per rule.
